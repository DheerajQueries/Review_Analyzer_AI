Review 1: Jessica P.
I bought this for my wife to use in doing her job which included a lot of RAM loading for use by two or three types of management software. Love the keyboard which is nice and tight and includes a dedicated number pad to the right side. The core i3 processor is decent and doesn't get overloaded until you really push it which is expected at this price pt.

Sometimes it may approach its memory limit but gives decent service - for just 8GB of RAM it works well and the sound quality isn't amazing but adequate. I consider it great value for money. I recommend it but probably with 16GB RAM and at least 500GB of SSD Storage.

While in Miami to the end of March this year, we visited 3 retailers of tech products and were amazed at the oversell of sub-standard electronics. When we found this after spending 1/2 day searching at major retailers, we grabbed it! Delivery took under two days and we were impressed with the performance of the laptop and we were able to avoid the over-sell and condescending attitude of poorly trained tech experts who seemed to know much less than me about their own products.

This is a great computer doing just what it has promised. Only problem was operator error in getting everything moved from my old computer. Good product. Reasonable price. Fast delivery.

Review 3: Brenda H.
I purchased this laptop March 22 2025, today is July 21 2024. This laptop had many issues right from month 2 it keeps over heating. Now it just has a constant black screen with a loading curser. I have tried troubleshooting and nothing has worked. I have downloaded NOTHING on this laptop. I literally only use it for work. I send emails and log onto my jobs website. I actually don’t use it that much. Total waste of money. I am beyond upset I would definitely not recommend. I read good reviews on this laptop because it’s a big purchase to me. I dropped over $300 and planned on having this for awhile. Now I am completely out of a laptop and money just 4 months later

Dell is the best laptop for the money. Period. I’ve owned dell computers and laptops for the past 25 years. None better

This is my first new laptop in a few decades so as you could imagine, it's pretty great! Nothing extraordinary here, but a great, fast, laptop to get work done or to shop on Amazon!

Aside from a few nit-picky changes that probably only affect me, the biggest reason I'm not happy with this model is that the mouse pad tracking area sits off center on the base. It makes it feel crowded when using and even after more than 3 months, I still can't get used to it and hate it. Another issue is the lack of back-lighting for the keyboard. Never again will I have a laptop (or any keyboard) that doesn't light up.
And not for nothing, but after having a touch-screen, I don't know if I can do without that either--but that's on me; I could've gone with that option, just didn't think it would be such a big deal. I was wrong...I'm still tapping this screen trying to get things to happen before I remember that I didn't pay for that!
Overall, would I get this one again? NO. But it does function well, so I guess I'm stuck with it until I get my money's worth of use out of it...

No bios. No TPN. Tried to contact support for warranty repair, Told support for the product ended in 2023. Funny, it's 2025 and purchased 'New' from Amazon. Now stuck with a broken computer that will cost more to repair than paid for.

Review 9: Brock

I didn't read the specs carefully enough. This does not have an Ethernet jack to plug into the internet. I was able to order an adapter to plug the Ethernet cable into a USB port. I could have ordered the dock, but that would have added an extra $250 and at that price I should have just bought the upgraded version.

The cheaper models of Dell have a known issue where the hinge on the monitor breaks. The screws come loose and if you are not watching, it will damage the plastic around the monitor. I leave my computer on a desk. When I do travel with it, I carry it in a padded laptop case. After 5 months of gentle use, this should not be a problem. I'm shipping it off to Dell for a repair. Technically I'm still under Basic warranty but we know they will still charge me for it. There is a long list of these complaints on the Dell support site about this and the company is not doing anything about it.

Works well for small jobs. Don't like that it records everything to the cloud. Have to remove often to make room for things you wish to store. After awhile it is necessary to save items to external drives.
